# Android on Chrome OS - Drag and Drop Demo

## This is not an official Google product

A demo android application demonstrating basic Drag and Drop functionality
with Chrome OS in mind.

Allows for plain-text items and files from the Chrome OS file manager to be
dragged into the app as well as PNGs and JPEGs. Has a plain-text item and PNG that can be dragged
out of the app.

Utilizes [`androix.core`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core)'s [`DragStartHelper`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/core/view/DragStartHelper) 
and [`androidx.draganddrop`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/draganddrop)'s `DropHelper` to simplify
the process of implementing both dragging and dropping functionality.
